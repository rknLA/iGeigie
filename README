SafeCast iGeigie PCB based on Pieter Franken and Sean Bonner's prototype.

There is currently nothing on the TODO list, though rerouting may not be a terrible idea.

The current design relies on 4xAAA batteries, and hardwiring a TRRS connector to the pcb.  A jack would be a better option, but takes up too much space.

Other battery designs would allow for more space and a larger board.
