v3 is the latest version of the schematic, which uses Sean Bonner's prototype as a reference.  The old Model 2 schematic was actually a previous version.

It's not yet complete, but it's redesigned using surface mount parts to fit in a 1.9" square (for a more streamlined enclosure).


TODO:
- CCFL board needs to be hacked.. the output capacitor needs to be bypassed.
- Capacitors need to be picked so we use the right footprints. 1210 maybe?
- Power switch needs to be selected.
- Currently no speaker, or capacitor discharge button. Probably no room for speaker
