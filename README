v2 schematic.  fairly complete, but could possibly use some work.

ccfl board footprint is in place (the JKL BXA-*** parts all have the same
dimensions), and a power switch is on the board.

digikey bom included as well

current design expects a piggy-back housing with top (or bottom) panel
that has the geiger window, the power switch, a power LED, and a click LED.

currently no speaker, or capacitor discharge button.

holes were too small for high power resistors (overkill anyways)

added 100k resistor from schematic, but it might need to be shorted when populating.

the -laen files are rough and incomplete.  next spin should probably be with friendly surface mount parts like 0805s.
