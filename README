v2 schematic.  fairly complete, but could possibly use some work.

ccfl board footprint is in place (the JKL BXA-*** parts all have the same
dimensions), and a power switch is on the board.

digikey bom included as well

current design expects a piggy-back housing with top (or bottom) panel
that has the geiger window, the power switch, a power LED, and a click LED.

currently no speaker, or capacitor discharge button.
